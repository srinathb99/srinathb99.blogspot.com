Blogger provides options to customize site-wide styles and add extra functionality via javascript (scripts must be hosted elsewhere). 
Here, I keep track of the custom configuration for [my blog](https://srinathb99.blogspot.com/). 
## Functionality added
- $\LaTeX$ support via [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
- Code rendering support via Google's [code-prettify](https://github.com/googlearchive/code-prettify)
